# Persin

Persin is a small SOCKS5 server for circumventing blocked websites in Russia.
It connects to another SOCKS5 server and routes traffic through it only to
hosts in blocklist or when connecting to specific ports (like port 80).

It's useful when you don't want to route your entire traffic through VPN/Proxy,
for example to access regionally-locked content.
